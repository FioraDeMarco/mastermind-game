ðŸŸ  `Mastermind Game`

This is a game that can be played "against" the computer. In this game, a player tries to guess a number combination. At the end of each attempt to guess the 4 number comination, the computer will provide feedback whether the player had guessed a number correctly, and/or the number index correctly. A player must get the number comination right within 10 attempts to win the game!
